Problem Statement: In our organisation, assessments were conducted for GET, and then the results were updated in Excel sheets. If admin wants to track a GET’s performance based on marks or wants to know which subject he or she hasn’t cleared yet, or for each subject, how many attempts he or she has taken to clear the assessments, in this kind of activity, we normally do it with the help of an excel sheet. If admin want to track one or two GET’s it will be easy, but if they want to do it for n numbers, it will consume more time. Likewise, the GET’S does not know their level and their mark. So, this is the problem that we are addressing.

Solution Walkthrough: In Visualization mode, the trainee's grades are visible. Save time and effort by easily tracking a student's performance according to subject. All student grades are collected in one location. Managing the trainee's grades is simple.
